To do:

0. Implement FIND which should have been done earlier

1.	edit <name_of_the_class> [<requirement> …] - edits values of the given record.

This command allows editing a given record if requirement conditions (which work the
same as in the find command) specify one record uniquely. Editing works the same as
adding a new element
	<name_of_field>=<value>
replace the field's old value with a new one until DONE or EXIT is provided. When 
EXIT is chosen, it does not modify any value.

2. PRINT - poprawić wypisywanie kolekcji

3. delete <name_of_the_class> [<requirement> …] - removes given record from collections.

This command allows deleting a given record if requirement conditions (which work the
same as in the find and edit command) specify one record uniquely.

4. queue load {filename} – loads commands to the end of the queue from the given file.

This command loads exported commands saved in a given file to the end of the queue.
The loaded command should be in the same order as they were during exporting.
Both file formats are supported: XML and plain-text.

NOTE: All features from previous parts should still work.
